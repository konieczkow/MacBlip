# MacBlip

MacBlip is a MacOSX client for [Blip.pl](http://blip.pl), Polish microblogging service, written in MacRuby.

The ObjectiveBlip directory contains the backend code that handles the connection to Blip API. It's a separate
subproject, available at [http://github.com/psionides/ObjectiveBlip](http://github.com/psionides/ObjectiveBlip), and you
can use it to create your own Blip clients in ObjectiveC/Cocoa if you want.

## Features

It compiles. And starts. :)

Currently it requires [MacRuby](http://macruby.org) 0.5 or later installed separately in the system.
And probably Snow Leopard too.
